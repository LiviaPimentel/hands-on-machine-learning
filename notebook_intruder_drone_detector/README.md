Application of Machine Learning techniques to the detection of invading drones using encrypted wi-fi traffic data. The applied methodology is based on an exploratory analysis of these data, followed by the pre-processing step and the validation of Machine Learning models to classify whether a wi-fi signal is originated by a drone or not.
