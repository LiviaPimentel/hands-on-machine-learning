Chapter 2: This chapter aims at the development of a real ML project. It uses California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California. In this project, the model should learn from data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
